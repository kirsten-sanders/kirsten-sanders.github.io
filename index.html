            <h2>Iceland Atlas Map</h2>
            <p>I created this map for my undergraduate Cartographic Design class in 2022. It was the first time that I was making a map that would be graded on both accuracy and aesthetics, so I spent a lot of time in the GIS lab tweaking colors, symbols, and labels. </p>

                <h2>The Shrinking Great Salt Lake</h2>
                <p>The Great Salt Lake (GSL) found in the Salt Lake Valley is a remnant of Lake Bonneville. In the 1980's the GSL reached record high levels. But by 2022, the lake has reached record lows. As Owens Lake in California has dried out it has become the main source of dust pollution in the U.S. with a price tag of $3.6 billion in damages (Wurtsbaugh & Sima, 2022). This research investigates potential links between the desiccation of the GSL and dust/particulate pollution. Two sizes of particulate pollution are usually examined, PM2.5 and PM10. The former is usually associated with very small particles that result from incomplete combustion of vehicle fuel etc. However, PM10 pollution is usually most associated with dust from industry or dried soils. Dust particulates can be enriched in poisonous heavy metals such as arsenic, copper, lead and zinc which increases the hazard to humans from the dust pollution. This study maps spatial patterns particulate air pollution as captured by the Purple Air network for a seven year period. These data are used in conjunction with imagery of the shrinking GSL and long term weather patterns. to give a broader understanding of how the lake's desiccation could be impacting air quality in the surrounding urban areas.</p>

                <h2>Heavy Metals in the Salt Lake Valley</h2>
                <p>Since it was founded in 1903, the Bingham Copper Mine has continually impacted the Salt Lake Valley in Utah. Toxic heavy metals, copper, lead, zinc and arsenic, have a number of potential health impacts such as respiratory illness, cancer, heart disease, violent behavior and depression. The uptake of metals by plants can be used to give an indication of their bioavailability. Soil and grass samples were collected throughout the Salt Lake valley from public parks to evaluate the levels of copper, lead, zinc and arsenic in the residential environment. A 1 km grid was overlaid on a map of the Salt Lake Valley and parks were chosen from every other grid square resulting in 58 parks to collect samples from. Samples were cut from the turfgrass and soil samples were taken from the top 10 cm of topsoil at each park. For large parks two samples were collected at opposite sides of the park. Coordinates were recorded at each sample point. The metal content of the soil samples were determined using a portable X-ray fluorescence analysis and ICP-OES was used to determine the metal content of grass samples. A hyperspectral radiometer was also used to analyze the grass samples. The wavelengths sensitive to enrichment with the heavy metals of interest were determined using separability indices. Correlation analysis was performed to determine the strength of relationships between reflectance values of grass samples in these key wavelengths and heavy metal concentrations in the grass measured using ICP-OES. The correlations between soil heavy metal and grass heavy metal correlations were also used as a measure of bioavailability of the metals. Contamination risk zones are determined through interpolating soil and grassheavy metal contents throughout the Salt Lake valley. Determining the wavelengths that aresensitive to heavy metals in this research suggests that hyperspectral surveys by drone couldhelp identify areas with a high risk of contamination and high degree of heavy metalbioavailability. Drone survey throughout the valley would increase the areas covered but resultin a far lower cost for sampling and analysis.</p>

                <h2>Using Hyperspectral Data to Determine Grass Health on BYU Campus</h2>
                <p>The Western United States, including Utah is currently experiencing a “mega drought”. Therefore, the need to limit water use in an efficient way has become essential. Turfgrass, a major vegetation type in urban areas, is the largest irrigated crop in the United States. It performs important ecosystem services such as cooling through evapotranspiration, fixing carbon from the atmosphere, and reducing wild-fire risk. Most residential turfgrass is irrigated using uniform protocols: for example, 20-30 minutes of irrigation every other day. However, more than 50% of irrigated water used on turfgrass is wasted by temporal and spatial misapplications. There are some solutions to this waste of water. Smart sprinklers reduce temporal misapplication by considering the weather of a particular area. Valve-in-head sprinklers can reduce wasted water through reducing spatial misapplications. In addition, sensors can help determine exactly how much water to apply in a certain area. The drawback to sensors is that they are expensive, and one needs ways to extrapolate rates to apply to zones. While spatial zones can be determined in several ways, some are more labor intensive than others. Traditionally, a ground survey would be performed using theta probes, NDVI readers, and infrared thermometers. However, we propose that using the EM38 takes less time and resources to get the similar information. Furthermore, this research works to link sensor measurements  from four locations in two fields on the Brigham Young University campus using ground survey, drone  survey, and EM38 maps, to determine how irrigation amounts should be varied between existing zones, or  zones determined for valve-in-head sprinklers.</p>
