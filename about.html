        <p class="centered-text">Hey there! I'm Kirsten, a passionate cartographer with a knack for blending art and science to create captivating maps. Originally from Mesa, Arizona, I've always had a thing for geography and exploration. Whether it's charting real-world landscapes or imagining mythical journeys, I love bringing stories to life through maps. With each project, I dive deep into the details, tweaking colors and symbols until everything feels just right. It's all about sparking curiosity and wonder about the world around us. So, join me on this cartographic adventure, and let's explore together!</p>
